1) fragmentation of free space, less efficient traversal of memory.
2) functions that free memory.
3) next is generally easy to compute, best preserves large blocks, worst preserves holes of even size, first is easy to compute
4-5 stress test did not complete
6) With the current system it is not possible as the items using the memory are given only a pointer, if we moved the memory we would not be able effect the code using that pointer.
7) Would need to provide the user with a lookup function that resolved a fake pointer into a real one, that would allow us to move memory around.
8) check for a free block after the current block, if the free block exists and is large enough increase it's pointer by the size requested, then increase the current block's size by the size requested.
9) malloc needs to know the requested strategy to find the block to allocate from.
10) allows for dynamic allocation chunk size and a dynamic quantity of blocks without wasting array size.
